description: More distrohopping to refresh a Thinkpad T420
---

One of my side projects right now is bringing an old Thinkpad T420 up to date. This has involved a bit of distro-hopping and experimentation. It's inspired, in part, by the failing keyboard on my newer Thinkpad, which is only 4 years old. The T4X0 series are famous for their comfortable and durable keyboards.

I've found the limiting factor is battery rather than memory or CPU (although those are factors). 3.5 hours of battery life quickly becomes 30 when watching videos or building containers. Earlier I [talked about the container-focused Fedora Silverblue](/posts/2024-11-09-silverblue/) and found that updates and experiments with desktop environments become prohibitive. These are among the few things that can't be run from a sandboxed container, so they require building large OCI images.

The next attempt was OpenBSD, which didn't quite work for some of the problems discussed in [this post](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2024-11-15-why-i-stopped-using-openbsd.html). Power optimization is becoming a goal of this project and OpenBSD had significant problems there.
